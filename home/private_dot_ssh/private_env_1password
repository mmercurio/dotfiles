##
# Set environment for using 1Password SSH Agent and CLI over SSH such
# that SSH Agent and 1Password CLI can be forwarded over SSH sessions
# consistently on macOS and Linux.
#
# See: https://github.com/mmercurio/dotfiles
#
# Requirements:
# - ~/.1password/agent.sock is symlinked to 1Password's SSH Agent socket.
#   (This is the default for Linux, but not not macOS.)
# - ~/bin/op is symlinked to 1Password CLI
# - ~/.ssh/config includes option to send LC_DESKTOP_HOST ("SendEnv LC_DESKTOP_HOST")
#
# This file is expected to be sourced by the login shell.
#
# When logged in locally on the desktop:
# - SSH_AUTH_SOCK is set and pointing to 1Password's ssh-agent socket.
# - LC_DESKTOP_HOST is set to the current hostname where 1Password is running.
#
# When logged in remotely over SSH:
# - `op` is aliased to run over SSH to the desktop where 1Password is running.

# Wrapper to execute `op` over ssh to the host where 1Password is running.
op_over_ssh() {
    if [[ -n "$TMUX" ]]; then
        # update shell's LC_DESKTOP_HOST from tmux session
        eval $(tmux showenv -s LC_DESKTOP_HOST)
    fi
    if [[ -n "$LC_DESKTOP_HOST" && "$LC_DESKTOP_HOST" != "$(hostname -s)" ]]; then
        # not running locally and LC_DESKOP_HOST is defined, execute op over SSH to desktop host
        ssh $LC_DESKTOP_HOST ./bin/op $*
    else
        ~/bin/op $*
    fi
}

# When not logged in remotely over SSH, set SSH_AUTH_SOCK to use 1Password as SSH Agent.
# When logged in remotely over SSH, use `op_over_ssh` wrapper for `op`.

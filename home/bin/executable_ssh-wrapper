# ssh wrapper for iTerm2
#
# Wraps ssh with additional environment to use
# 1Password SSH Agent and CLI over SSH sessions.
#
# Why is this needed?
#
# It's needed when launching ssh directly from Iterm2 Profiles
# because iTerm2 uses a very limited environment for non-login
# shells. (e.g., PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin and no
# user environment is loaded.)

# Load in additional env for 1Password over SSH
